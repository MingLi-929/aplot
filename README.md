# `aplot` for decorating a plot with associated information

For many times, we are not just aligning plots as what ‘cowplot’ and
‘patchwork’ did. Users would like to align associated information that
requires axes to be exactly matched in subplots, e.g. hierarchical
clustering with a heatmap. This package provides utilities to aligns
associated subplots to a main plot at different sides (left, right, top
and bottom) with axes exactly matched.
